name: BNN migration boundaries
description: Project decisions for migrating Banana Cat Hub farming features and settings.
---

Migrate BNN features in functional slices, and add settings alongside the feature that uses them. Use this project’s configuration path rather than copying BNN executor filesystem persistence. Do not expose BNN controls until their behavior is implemented.

For the Tiki Outpost puzzle, automatically use any currently ready skill; do not expose puzzle-only skill selection settings. Regular farming skill selection is separate and opt-in. Skull Guitar may be loaded and used against puzzle objects only if already owned; never buy items or server-hop for this feature. Resume the selected Farm Weapon after the puzzle phase.

Do not port BNN's game-wide `__namecall` aim hook. Keep skill aiming temporary and target-scoped through the game's Mouse module, verify that the aim assignment works before sending a key, and release the key on cancellation.

**Why:** the user sees no value in configuring skills used only for the Tiki puzzle and requested that it use any available skill automatically. They approved normal farming skill settings separately. The user did not approve purchases or server hopping. BNN also relies on executor-specific persistence and remote-interception APIs that are not portable or safely scoped.

**How to apply:** for future BNN farming migrations, keep the tested Level Farm path intact, implement each mode with its related settings, and keep unimplemented modes out of the UI. Keep Tiki automation event-scoped and automatic, avoid global remote hooks, keep normal-farm skill controls independent, and resume the selected Farm Weapon after temporary equipment changes.

For Gun Mastery, the user explicitly wants the BNN-style gun M1 path alongside selected skills. Keep the reference validator and ShootGunEvent flow, including its weapon-specific cases, rather than substituting normal Tool activation.

**Why:** the user asked to match the reference implementation now and handle compatibility issues after in-game testing.

**How to apply:** keep this path limited to the Gun Mastery phase after the character reaches attack position; retain range/reload/cooldown checks and selected skill usage, and label success as an issued request until in-game damage is confirmed.
